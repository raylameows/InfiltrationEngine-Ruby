# Ruby
Ruby is an automatic update fetcher for [InfiltrationEngine-Custom-Missions](https://github.com/MoonstoneSkies/InfiltrationEngine-Custom-Missions). As long as a major change isn't made to the serializer, you will never have to reinstall anything serializer-related again.

Ruby will automatically fetch **SerializationTools** and set it up for you in `ReplicatedStorage/Plugins/Ruby/SerializationTools`. This folder is also used as a cache to prevent sending a million HTTP requests every time you open Studio.

## Terms Of Use
- You may **not** use Ruby to build SerializationTools; use a different method for that (you'd end up with a broken *Fetch Source* button anyway).  
- All modifications made to Ruby must be shared publicly with full source code to allow others to benefit from your changes.
